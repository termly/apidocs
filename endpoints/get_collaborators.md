# Overview

Retrieve all or some of the collaborators for the specified query. The query has the following JSON shape:

```json
[
	{
		"account_id": "<string>",
		"ids": [
			"<string>"
		]
	}
]

```

At least 1 object with the field `account_id` is required. If you wish to retrieve all collaborators for an account, omit the `ids` field. Once the query is constructed, it passed in the query string parameter `query`. It must be URL encoded.

The response has the following shape:

```json
{
	"results": [],
	"errors": [],
	"paging": {}
}

```

`results` will contain 0 or more of the following objects:

```json
{
	"id": "<string>",
	"account_id": "<string>",
	"email": "<string>",
	"first_name": "<string|null>",
	"last_name": "<string|null>",
	"role": "<enum{'admin', 'owner', 'editor'}>",
	"website_ids": [
		"<string>"
	]
}

```

* `id` is the unique identifier of the collaborator.
* `account_id` is the unique identifier of the account which owns the collaborator.
* `email` is the email address of the collaborator
* `first_name` is the Given name of the collaborator if provided by the collaborator upon signing in for the first time.
* `last_name` is the Surname of the collaborator if provided by the collaborator upon signing in for the first time.
* `role` is one of the following values - `admin`, `owner`, or `editor`. Please see [here](collaborator_roles.md) for details.
* `website_ids` is an array of website unique identifiers. This field is only provided if the `role` is `editor`.

`errors` will have 0 or more of the [error object](../error_object.md).

`paging` is an object that indicates if there are more results to retrieve. Please see [paging](../paging_object.md)
