    "account_id": "<string>",
    "website_id": "<string>",
    "ids": [

    ]
  }
]
```

The body must have 1 or more of these objects.  Once created, the JSON must be passed as the request body.

The response is an array of success or error response objects with this shape:

```
[
  {
    "account_id": "<string>",
    "website_id": "<string>",
    "_idx": <integer>
  }
]
```

The shape of an error object is described [here](../error_object.md#post-put-delete-error-object).

If the entire request is in error or invalid the result JSON will be [error object](../error_object.md#universal-errors)
